"""
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should
treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s
to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and
since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it
is called Dutch National Flag problem.

    low points to the end of 0s
    high points to the start of 2s

    low and high are bounds on which elements should swapped

    key thing here is why we increment/decrement i, low and high:
    1) i = 1:
       i++ because we ignore the 1s, as we swap the elements
       on low and high positions
    2) i = 0:
       low += 1 because we moved zero on low place and we need to have
       a pointer to the value we can replace on next iteration
       i += 1 because we cannot have 2 there, and since we are ignoring
       1s we increment our main pointer
    3) i = 2:
       we only decrement high, because we swap the elements and on the position
       of i could appear 0 or 1, skipping which would be unwanted thing to do
